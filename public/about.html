<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Joseph, 30 years old, working as a production leader in a small factory.
  Recently I started learning full-stack web development through Angela Yu's
  course on Udemy. My goal is simple: to change careers and start building
  useful things on the web while sharing my journey here. Outside of work and
  study, I enjoy painting 3D-printed models, gaming on my PS5, and just
  chilling.
